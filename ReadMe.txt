-- Music Player Application

This is a simple Python application that uses the Tkinter library to create a basic music player. The application allows you to load and play MP3 audio files from a specified playlist directory. You can control playback, pause, stop, skip to the next or previous track, and select tracks from a list.

-- Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. The `pygame` library installed. You can install it using pip:

   pip install pygame


3. MP3 audio files in a directory named "playlist" within the same directory as the script. Ensure that your MP3 files have the ".mp3" file extension.

-- How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository containing this code and place your MP3 audio files in a directory named "playlist" within the same directory as the script.

2. Run the following command to start the Music Player application:

   python music_player.py


3. The Music Player window will open, displaying a list of available tracks from the "playlist" directory.

   - **Play**: Click to play the selected track.
   - **Pause**: Click to pause or resume playback.
   - **Stop**: Click to stop playback.
